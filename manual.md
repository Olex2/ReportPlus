ReportPlus
==========

**ReportPlus** is an extension module for Olex2. It provides extended report functionality, including the ability to create reports across a number of structures. Various output formats are supported:

- \LaTeX (for the generation of PDF files)
- RTF (for copy/paste into MS Word)
- HTML (for web content)

**ReportPlus** will eventually provide many tools that are required to prepare complete and professional reports from *.cif* files. These reports will be fully customisable.

The aim is to provide a one-button report function that will fully automatially prepare standard structure reports, either for internal archiving or to provide complete structural information for further inclusion in theses and publications.
